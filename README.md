The program implements a simplified version of Yatzy game where by it simulates a single player interacting with the program via Console. The role of human user is limited to advancing 
the program to take next turn ( or optionally, send Stop signal to end the game at any time). The game ends either by user's prompt or when the game concluding condition has reached, namely, 
all the six categories ( from Ones to Sixes) are scored.
